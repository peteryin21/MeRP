Mendelian Randomization Pipeline Version 1.0

*Currently, a directory data/ is required for analysis but is not available on github because of size. Please contact peteryin@sas.upenn.edu for directory.

1. Pull GWAS Catalog and Clean
	Run this python command first after downloading package to create files from up to date GWAS Catalog.
	Frozen version from 12/18/13 catalog included in package.

	Usage: $ python bin/gwas_pull.py 

	
2. Prepare and Format Trait Files
	Run this python command with trait file(s) of interest.
	Usage $ python bin/update.py [path/to/trait_files] 

	Output:
	-Updated file added to /traitFiles as #_update. (1_update)
	-List of SNPs without allele info from 1000 genomes if applicable

3. Filtering
	
	Usage: $ python bin/filter.py [path/to/trait_file_update] [include_file] [exclude_file] 

	Output:
	-Trait file filtered for confounding associations and added to /traitFiles as #_updatefiltered 

	
	[include_traits]: link to path of file (e.g bin/include.txt) with list of traits that are found in NHGRI catalog that may be related to or similar to trait of interest but is not confounding.
		For example, if trait of interest is LDL or HDL cholesterol, our file would contain "total, cholesterol" as worded in NHGRI catalog.
		Suggestion: Run once with empty file-program will print out exclusions b/c of diseases, and select those that are too similar to trait of interest from there.
	
	[exclude_traits]: link to path of file (e.g bin/exclude.txt) with list of column titles from data/v3abr_allmetabolic_pvals_v2.txt that are/are related closely to trait of interest. 
		For example, if trait of interest is LDL cholesterol, our file would contain "P_LDL" 
		Suggestion: run $ head -1 data/v3abr_allmetabolic_pvals_v2.txt to see all column headers before creating exclude.txt file.
 

4. MR Caluculation with Final Trait Files and Disease Endpoints
	Usage: $ python bin/mr_calc.py [final_trait_file] [disease_file]
	*Just name of file, not path for each arg

	Output: individual and summary mr results in /analysis

	If user input disease file, must include following values in each column
	rs id = column 1
	allele1= column 3
	riskallele = column 5
	lnOR = column 12
	lnse = column 13
	For example see cardiogram file
